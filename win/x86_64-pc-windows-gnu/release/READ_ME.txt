Hello!

This is my first gui using the iced.rs gui library (as well as my first calculator!)
It has some basic functionality at this such as

  - Doing operations on 1 or 2 digits
  - Functions like sin, cos, tan and exp
  - Negative and positive numbers
  - As well as keyboard inputs!
  _ ..And More!

I will work towards adding more features over time!
